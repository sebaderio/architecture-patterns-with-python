# Architecture Patterns with Python

Implementation of common architecture patterns. Inspired by the book [Architecture Patterns with Python](https://www.cosmicpython.com/).

This repository is just a playground.
Implemented solutions can serve as an inspiration for production-grade solutions, but author does not guarantee the full correctness.

## Implemented

1. Domain Model with Aggregate
2. Repository pattern
3. Unit of Work pattern
4. Ports layer - Abstraction
5. Adapters layer - Implementation
6. Dependency Injection
7. Event Driven Architecture
8. Command Bus
9. Command handlers - Service layer
10. Event Bus
11. Event Listeners
12. Event Publisher
13. Event Consumers - workers
14. CQRS pattern
15. Postgres backed Command responsibility
16. Redis backed Cache Query responsibility
17. Event based Cache Query updates
18. REST API - Presentation layer
